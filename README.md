## Uncensored Forgotten Hope 2 Texture Pack

[![Build and release](https://github.com/AlexRuiz7/fh2_uncensored_texture_pack/actions/workflows/build-and-release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AlexRuiz7/fh2_uncensored_texture_pack/actions/workflows/build-and-release.yml)

This is a texture pack for the [Forgotten Hope 2][website] mod for Battlefield 2. This 
texture pack replaces some of the textures in the game with uncensored versions.

Although Forgotten Hope 2 aims to be historically accurate, some of the textures in the 
game are censored due to German laws. See [Strafgesetzbuch section 86a][86a] for more information.

This texture pack was not made to promote Nazism. The one and only purpose of this pack is to make the game even more historically accurate. If this is distributed to any country where it is illegal to display or distribute any Nazi imagery, then you, as the user, assume full responsibility, risk and liability, legal or otherwise, associated with the use of these files.

If anyone from the FH2 dev team does not want me to distribute this texture
pack, please send me a private message/post a comment.

**Disclaimer: this texture pack is not endorsed by the Forgotten Hope 2 team. Use at your own risk.**

### Installation

1. Download the latest version of the texture pack from the [releases page](https://github.com/AlexRuiz7/fh2_uncensored_texture_pack/releases).

2. Extract the package to any location.

3. Copy `objects_uncensored.zip`, `menu_uncensored.zip` and `ClientArchives.con` to your Forgotten Hope 2 mod folder. The path should look like this: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Forgotten Hope 2\mods\fh2`. **DO NOT EXTRACT THESE ZIP FILES**.

4. When prompted, choose to replace the existing files.

This will replace any previous version of the texture pack already installed. Be aware that the `ClientArchives.con` will be replaced too, so any changes made to it will be lost, for example, if you load additional custom content such as this texture pack. If you want to keep your changes, you can merge the two files manually.

```
rem === Custom Archives === 
fileManager.mountArchive menu_uncensored.zip Menu
fileManager.mountArchive objects_uncensored.zip Objects
```

If you are also using the **Matt_Baker**'s texture pack, load it before this pack in the `ClientArchives.con` file:

```
rem === Custom Archives ===
fileManager.mountArchive MattBakersTexturePack.zip Objects
fileManager.mountArchive menu_uncensored.zip Menu
fileManager.mountArchive objects_uncensored.zip Objects
```

### Uninstall


#### Manual

To uninstall this texture pack, just remove or comment the lines added to the `ClientArchives.con` file. To comment a line, prefix it with `rem`:

```
rem fileManager.mountArchive menu_uncensored.zip Menu
rem fileManager.mountArchive objects_uncensored.zip Objects
```

To completely remove the texture pack, remove the `objects_uncensored.zip` and `menu_uncensored.zip` files from your Forgotten Hope 2 mod folder.


#### Using the launcher

**Note: any modified content will be reset to default**

Go to "Options" â†’ "Update / Repair" in the FH2 Launcher and hit "Repair".
